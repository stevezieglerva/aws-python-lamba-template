# aws-python-lamba-template

This is a basic set of files and folder structure for my typical AWS Lambda in Python. It allows me to run tests, commit changes to GH, and publish the code to the Lambda.

You will still need to:
* setup the virutal environment
* install any requirements
* replace the Lambda name variable in package.bat
* uncomment the deployment steps in package.bat
